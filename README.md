# powerplannerapps
The mobile apps for Power Planner


## Building

1. For the first time, generate the secrets
    1. In the top-level directory, open PowerShell and run `.\ApplySecrets.ps1`
        1. This will generate a blank `secrets.json` file (ignored from git), and generate the corresponding secret files needed to compile the app
        1. If you have actual secrets to use, update the `secrets.json` file with the secrets and re-run `.\ApplySecrets.ps1`
        1. Note that the app still should compile and run without actual secrets, but things like accessing the server won't work (offline accounts should work though).
1. Open the `PowerPlannerApps.sln` solution and you should be able to build the projects!
